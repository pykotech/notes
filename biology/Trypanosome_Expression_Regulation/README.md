Trypanosome Regulation Expression
=================================
--2013/05/18--

I. Overview
===========

Eukaryotic gene regulation
--------------------------
-Around 4-8% genes encode for TFs.
-Many pathways involving environmental signals affect transcription
-Kinetoplastids have evolved to not regulation transcription!

Polycistronic genes
-------------------
-Protein coding genes are arranged in long tandem arrays and are transcribed
as polycistrons of 10-100 genes.
-Processing into mature monocistronic mRNAs involves addition of 5' spliced
leader (from SL-RNA) and poly-A tail addition at 3' end of each mRNA.
-It is believed that polycistronic precursor RNAs are transcribed at the
same rate -- any differences thus must result post-transcriptionally!
-T. brucei VSG and a few other genes transcribed by RNA-Pol I.

Trans-splicing
--------------
-Both trans-splicing and polycistronic transcription are found in other species,
however, trypanosomes are the only ones to use it for their entire genome.
Other examples:
    *Dinoflagellates

Trypanosome genome architecture
-------------------------------
-Few introns
-Chromosomes do not condensate during mitosis
-Protein coding genes arrange in long tandem arrays with small intergenic
regions.
-Only known RNA-Pol II promotor is that of SL RNA gene.
-Instead of the classical RNAPolII promotor, TSSs (both start and stop sites) 
of polycistronic transcription units marked epigentically via histone variants/
modified histones.


II. Mechanisms of regulation
============================

1. Chromatin
------------
-In many bacteria, DNA can sense and respond directly to environmental changes.
    *ex. DNA supercoiling in response to temperature change.
-This hasn't been observed in eukaryotes: it is thought to occur through an
indirect route (e.g. TFs or epigenetic changes to DNA).

2. Alternative trans-splicing
-----------------------------

***Alternative cis-splicing
-In humans, more than 90% of genes undergo alternative splicing.
-4.5% of plasmodium genes are alternatively spliced.
-In plasmodium, this may also play a role in RNA stability: 10% of alternative
splicing events produce altered UTRs and 2/3 of remaining result in frame-shift
and premature stop codons (=> nonsense-mediated decay)

***Alternative trans-splicing
-More than half of T. brucei genes have multiple 5' splice acceptor sites, and
there is even greater variation among adenylation sites.
-Thus, EACH T. BRUCEI mRNA WILL USUALLY EXIST IN SEVERAL DIFFERENT ISOFORMS; in
most cases the isoforms differ slightly in UTR length.
-This may just be noise; tran-splicing accuracy may not be as important as
cis-splicing, however,
-Some events have been found to result in alternate localization of protein
products.
-Examples in T. cruzi:
    *LYT1 produces two protein products which differ by 28aa and have different
     localizations.
    *TcPRACA



Questions
=========
-How much of genome is noncoding compared with other Eukaryotes?
-Nonsense mediated decay pathway?
