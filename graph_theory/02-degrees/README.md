Overview
========
These notes are structured after the first chapter of the book [A First Course In
Graph Theory](http://store.doverpublications.com/0486483681.html) by Gary
Chartrand and Ping Zhang but include material from other sources as well. I
will try and list all of the sources of material in the references.
