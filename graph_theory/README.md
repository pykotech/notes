Graph Theory
============
Notes on graph various topics in graph theory.

The notes are based largely on the introductory text, [A First Course In
Graph Theory](http://store.doverpublications.com/0486483681.html) by Gary 
Chartrand and Ping Zhang, but materials from other sources are often 
incorporated, as well as short code snippets I've written to test out various
ideas.
