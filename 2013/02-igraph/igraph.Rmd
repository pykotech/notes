Overview
========
Just playing around with [igraph](http://igraph.sourceforge.net/).

1. Creating an adjacency matrix
===============================
First, let's try plotting a few different adjaceny matrices. To do so, you can
simply use the `graph.adjaceny` function.

```{r adjacency_matrix}
library(igraph)

# Identity matrix (not the most exciting network...)
x = diag(4)
x
plot(graph.adjacency(x))

# two nodes that are completely connected and two with zero connectivity
y = matrix(rep(c(0,1), 8), 4, 4)
y
plot(graph.adjacency(y))

# a random network
set.seed(1)
z <- matrix(sample(0:1, 16, replace=T), 4, 4)
z
plot(graph.adjacency(z))
```
