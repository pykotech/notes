1.1 Graphs and Graph Models
---------------------------

## Graph definition
- A graph $G$ consists of a finite nonempty set $V$ of objected call `vertices`
and  a set $E$ of 2-element subsets of $V$ called **edges**.
- $V$ and $E$ are the `vertex set` and `edge set`
- $G$ is the *ordered* set containing $V$ and $E$
